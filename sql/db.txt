Mia, picturing little Mayan (get it) temples - is it best when the base cheese is a bit more dense? (lol, don't answer)

Miami! Yes, a friend did his undergrad there. They have one of the few terminal Master's of econ programs. Myself, I did an undergrad at OSU (the Harvard of just north of downtown, as they say).

You studied, hmm, i'm thinking a humanities and/or maybe statistics. 

Enjoy: Fiona Apple, Sebadoh, BoJack (that horse is a dick), Invisible Man, and Black Mirror creeps me out too.

Might I recommend, Cobra Kai (you probably already heard). And, since our context is dating, a cute little movie called Timer. 

By the way is New York ok now? Be safe. I don't really have friends there anymore so not much update besides the news.
